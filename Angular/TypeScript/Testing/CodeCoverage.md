# code coverage? 

Code coverage is a metric used in software testing to measure the degree to which the source code of a program is executed during testing. It aids in identifying the extent to which the source code is being exercised, allowing you to acquire a better awareness of your testing efforts and where extra testing may be required.

The goal of code coverage is to discover sections of a program that are not being exercised by a set of test cases; therefore guiding the development of new tests to obtain better coverage. 

The term "code coverage" derives from the field of software testing, where it is used to determine which sections of the code are covered (tested) and which are not. This data is quite helpful in understanding the quality of the test cases and the comprehensiveness of the testing.
What is code coverage testing? 

Code coverage testing is a type of software testing that determines the extent to which your test executes your source code. The major purpose of code coverage testing is to identify sections that have not been tested and to guarantee that the application's essential paths have been tested.
Identify the code that needs to be tested

First, you need to identify the source code that must be tested which could be the whole application or just a particular module. 
Prepare the test suite

Then, the test suite is prepared that includes all of the test cases that will be used to test the identified code. Unit tests, integration tests, and system tests may all be included in this step. 
Run the test

The test suite is executed against the identified code. As the test suite runs, various components of the code run. 
Analyze the data coverage

After the test suite has been completed, the coverage data is examined. This could include producing a coverage report that reveals which sections of the code were it was and was not executed.
Improve the test suite

If the coverage data shows that some sections of the code weren't carried out by the test suite, more tests can be developed to cover those sections. The goal is to gradually improve the test suite in order to increase code coverage.
